Board data reducer
- use board squares as keys for data
- assumption that 1 piece per sq
- ~~use letter-number combination for keys (a1, e4, etc.)~~
  - probably just use 0-63, for example, and convert that into rank/file, row/col
- use reducer to handle moves?
  - what does this mean for adding rules?
  
- styledComponents for parameterized board
